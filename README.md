# Text Generation with Keras

This repository contains the implementation of text generation using Keras, a deep learning library for Python. Text generation is a type of natural language processing (NLP) task that involves training a model to generate human-like text based on a given input.

## Features
- Implementation of text generation using Keras
- Example notebooks demonstrating the text generation process
- Contains sample datasets for training and validation

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubhamDarmwar/TextGenerationWithKeras.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd TextGenerationWithKeras
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the implementation and examples.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Keras
- TensorFlow

## Installation
You can install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the notebook files and run them to see the text generation process in action.
